# Master Intent Outline

## glass.framework: Root intent for the Glass Framework — AI-authored, human-auditable, formally verified software
  - glass.adapters: Group intent for Glass language adapters — translate Glass contracts to target languages
    - adapters.typescript: Provide TypeScript language adapter for Glass compilation
  - glass.cli: Group intent for the Glass CLI — user-facing commands for the Glass framework
    - cli.cmd_annotate: Add, list, and resolve human annotations on Glass units
    - cli.cmd_audit: Display audit trail for Glass project changes
    - cli.cmd_build: Legacy compile command using GlassCompiler class
    - cli.cmd_compile: Run the full compilation pipeline: verify, generate views, emit TypeScript
    - cli.cmd_eject: Eject a Glass project to standalone TypeScript code independent of Glass
    - cli.cmd_init: Initialize a new Glass project with directory structure, manifest, and configuration
    - cli.cmd_status: Display verification status dashboard for the Glass project
    - cli.cmd_trace: Show the provenance chain from root to a specific Glass unit
    - cli.cmd_tree: Display the intent hierarchy tree with approval status and sources
    - cli.cmd_verify: Run contract verification on all Glass files and display results
    - cli.cmd_views: Generate human-readable views from Glass files
    - cli.entry: Register and dispatch all Glass CLI commands via Commander.js
    - cli.utils: Provide shared utilities for CLI commands including .glass file discovery and project loading
  - glass.compiler: Group intent for the Glass compiler pipeline — parse, link, verify, and emit
    - compiler.annotations: "Manage human annotations on Glass units for AI-human collaboration"
    - compiler.emitter: Output clean standard TypeScript from verified .glass files with dependency resolution and atomic writes
    - compiler.orchestrator: Orchestrate the full Glass compilation pipeline (parse, link, verify, emit)
    - compiler.linker: Build and validate the intent tree from parsed .glass files, resolving parent-child relationships
    - compiler.parser: Parse .glass files into structured GlassFile objects, extracting the three layers (Intent, Contract, Implementation)
    - compiler.verifier: Verify that implementations satisfy their contracts through static analysis and pattern matching
    - compiler.view_generator: Generate human-readable views, checklists, and dashboards from Glass units for stakeholder review
  - glass.entry: Export the complete Glass public API as a single entry point
  - glass.mcp: Group intent for the Glass MCP server — expose Glass tools via Model Context Protocol
    - mcp.server: Initialize and start the Glass MCP server with stdio transport
    - mcp.tools: Register Glass operations as MCP tools for AI assistant integration
  - types.core: Define all Glass framework type definitions including Result<T,E>, GlassFile, Contract, Intent, and compiler types
