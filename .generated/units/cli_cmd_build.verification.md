# Verification: cli.cmd_build

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 8/8 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Source directory contains .glass files
  - Precondition requires runtime verification
- [+] Runs GlassCompiler.compile() pipeline
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Displays diagnostic messages with severity colors
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 0
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Displays error diagnostics
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 1
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Delegates to GlassCompiler class
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: CompilationFailed
  - Error 'CompilationFailed' referenced in implementation

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: Source directory contains .glass files — Precondition requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Runs GlassCompiler.compile() pipeline — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Displays diagnostic messages with severity colors — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Exit code is 0 — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Displays error diagnostics — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Exit code is 1 — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Delegates to GlassCompiler class — Invariant requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Failure mode handled: CompilationFailed — Error 'CompilationFailed' referenced in implementation
- Uses GlassCompiler stub; glass compile command provides the real pipeline
