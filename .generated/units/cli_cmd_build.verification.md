# Verification: cli.cmd_build

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 8/8 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Source directory contains .glass files
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] Runs GlassCompiler.compile() pipeline
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Displays diagnostic messages with severity colors
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Exit code is 0
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Displays error diagnostics
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Exit code is 1
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Delegates to GlassCompiler class
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: CompilationFailed
  - Error type 'CompilationFailed' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: Source directory contains .glass files — Precondition will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Runs GlassCompiler.compile() pipeline — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Displays diagnostic messages with severity colors — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Exit code is 0 — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Displays error diagnostics — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Exit code is 1 — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Delegates to GlassCompiler class — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Failure mode handled: CompilationFailed — Error type 'CompilationFailed' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime
- Uses GlassCompiler stub; glass compile command provides the real pipeline
