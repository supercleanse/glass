# Verification: cli.cmd_compile

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 15/15 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Current directory or --source flag points to a valid Glass project
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] Output directory is writable
  - Precondition requires runtime verification
- [+] All contracts verified before emission
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Views generated in .generated/ directory
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] TypeScript emitted to output directory
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Compilation duration reported
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 0
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Compilation halted at failing stage
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Error message identifies the failing stage and unit
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 1
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Unverified code is never emitted
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: ProjectNotFound
  - Error 'ProjectNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: VerificationFailed
  - Error 'VerificationFailed' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: EmitFailed
  - Error 'EmitFailed' referenced in implementation

## PROVEN

- [+] Source .glass files are never modified
  - 'files' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
