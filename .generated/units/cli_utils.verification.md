# Verification: cli.utils

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 8/8 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] dir is a valid directory path
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] discoverGlassFiles returns all .glass files recursively under dir
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] discoverGlassFiles excludes node_modules, .generated, and manifest.glass
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] discoverGlassFiles returns empty array if directory does not exist
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] loadProject returns Err with descriptive error message
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] loadProject runs the full pipeline: parse, link, verify
  - Invariant requires runtime verification

## PROVEN

- [+] loadProject returns ProjectContext with parsed files, linked tree, and verification results
  - Return type 'Result<ProjectContext, string>' contains 'ProjectContext'
- [+] Discovery never modifies files
  - 'discovery' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: dir is a valid directory path — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: discoverGlassFiles returns all .glass files recursively under dir — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: discoverGlassFiles excludes node_modules, .generated, and manifest.glass — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: discoverGlassFiles returns empty array if directory does not exist — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: loadProject returns Err with descriptive error message — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: loadProject runs the full pipeline: parse, link, verify — Invariant requires runtime verification
