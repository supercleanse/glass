## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "filePath is a valid string path"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "file exists on disk for parseGlassFile"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "content follows .glass format with four sections"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Returns GlassFile with all three sections extracted"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "id, version, and language are populated from Glass Unit header"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Intent has purpose, source, parent, stakeholder, subIntents"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Contract has requires, guarantees, invariants, fails, advisories"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Returns ParseError with reason, message, and filePath"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "ParseError includes section where failure occurred"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
