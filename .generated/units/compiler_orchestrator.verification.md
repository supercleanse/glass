## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "sourcePaths is an array of valid file paths" — Precondition will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "CompilerOptions provides rootDir and outDir" — Precondition will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Returns CompilationResult with success: true" — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Pipeline stages execute in order: parse, link, verify, emit" — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Diagnostics array contains info messages for each stage" — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Duration reflects actual elapsed time in milliseconds" — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Returns CompilationResult with success: false" — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Diagnostics include error messages identifying the failing stage" — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Source files are never modified" — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Pipeline stages are idempotent" fails: [] — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- "GlassCompiler.compile() is currently a stub; real pipeline runs through CLI commands via loadProject()"
