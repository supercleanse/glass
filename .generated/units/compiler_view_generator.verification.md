# Verification: compiler.view_generator

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 15/15 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] files is a non-empty array of valid GlassFile objects
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] tree is a valid IntentTree with all references resolved
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] results contains a VerificationResult for each file
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] outputDir is a valid writable path
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] Generates per-unit views: intent outline, contract outline, verification checklist
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Generates aggregate views: business view, security view, verification dashboard
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Generates master documents: master intent outline, master contract outline
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] All views are valid markdown with auto-generated header
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Returns array of all generated file paths
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Returns ViewGeneratorError with reason and message
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Source .glass files are never modified
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] View generation is deterministic
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Generated views reflect current state of inputs
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidInput
  - Error type 'InvalidInput' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime

## PROVEN

- [+] Failure mode handled: WriteError
  - Error type 'WriteError' is caught and handled with appropriate response
