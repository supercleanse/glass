# Verification: compiler.view_generator

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 15/15 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] files is a non-empty array of valid GlassFile objects
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] results contains a VerificationResult for each file
  - Parameter referenced but type match not confirmable
- [+] outputDir is a valid writable path
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] Generates per-unit views: intent outline, contract outline, verification checklist
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Generates aggregate views: business view, security view, verification dashboard
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Generates master documents: master intent outline, master contract outline
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] All views are valid markdown with auto-generated header
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Returns array of all generated file paths
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Generated views reflect current state of inputs
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidInput
  - Error 'InvalidInput' referenced; try/catch present

## PROVEN

- [+] tree is a valid IntentTree with all references resolved
  - Parameter 'tree' has type 'IntentTree' in generateBusinessView()
- [+] Returns ViewGeneratorError with reason and message
  - Failure return type contains 'ViewGeneratorError'
- [+] Source .glass files are never modified
  - 'files' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] View generation is deterministic
  - No non-deterministic calls detected
- [+] Failure mode handled: WriteError
  - Error 'WriteError' found in Err() call via AST
