# Verification: adapters.typescript

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 4/4 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] GlassFile has language: typescript
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] LanguageAdapter interface defines name, fileExtension, and compile method
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] typescriptAdapter implements LanguageAdapter for TypeScript targets on_failure: []
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Adapter is stateless
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: GlassFile has language: typescript — Precondition will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: LanguageAdapter interface defines name, fileExtension, and compile method — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: typescriptAdapter implements LanguageAdapter for TypeScript targets on_failure: [] — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Adapter is stateless — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- Placeholder implementation — actual TypeScript compilation handled by emitter
