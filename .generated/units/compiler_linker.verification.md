# Verification: compiler.linker

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 12/12 passed

## PROVEN

- [+] "files is an array of valid GlassFile objects"
  - Parameter 'files' has type 'GlassFile[]' in linkIntentTree()
- [+] "Returns IntentTree with all relationships resolved"
  - Return type 'Result<IntentTree, LinkError>' contains 'IntentTree'
- [+] "Returns LinkError with reason and unitId"
  - Failure return type contains 'LinkError'
- [+] "Input files are never modified"
  - 'files' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] "Linker is deterministic"
  - No non-deterministic calls detected
- [+] Failure mode handled: DanglingReference
  - Error 'DanglingReference' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: CircularDependency
  - Error 'CircularDependency' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: DuplicateId
  - Error 'DuplicateId' found in Err() call via AST

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "each file has a unique id"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "No circular dependencies exist"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "All parent references point to existing files"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "All sub-intent references point to existing files"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "each file has a unique id" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "No circular dependencies exist" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "All parent references point to existing files" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "All sub-intent references point to existing files" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
