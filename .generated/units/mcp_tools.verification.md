# Verification: mcp.tools

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 9/9 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] server is a valid McpServer instance
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] projectRoot is a valid directory path
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] Registers 10 tools: glass_init, glass_verify, glass_compile, glass_views, glass_status, glass_tree, glass_trace, glass_annotate, glass_annotations_list
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Each tool has a Zod schema for input validation
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Each tool returns JSON with success boolean and data/error fields
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Tool-specific errors returned as JSON with success: false
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Tool registration is idempotent
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Tool schemas match their implementations
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: ToolExecutionFailed
  - Error type 'ToolExecutionFailed' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime
