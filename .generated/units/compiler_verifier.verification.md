# Verification: compiler.verifier

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 10/10 passed

## PROVEN

- [+] "file is a valid GlassFile with contract and implementation"
  - Parameter 'file' has type 'GlassFile' in generateInstrumentation()
- [+] "Returns VerificationResult with all assertions checked"
  - Return type 'VerificationResult' contains 'VerificationResult'
- [+] "Returns VerificationResult with status FAILED"
  - Failure return type contains 'VerificationResult'
- [+] "Implementation code is never modified"
  - 'code' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] "Verification is deterministic — same input produces same output" fails: []
  - No non-deterministic calls detected

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "Each assertion has a verification level (PROVEN, INSTRUMENTED, TESTED, UNVERIFIABLE)"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Overall status is PROVEN if all assertions pass"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "verifyAll uses batch ts.Program for performance"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "Uses Phase 2 AST verification when ts.Program available, falls back to Phase 1"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Failed assertions include explanation messages"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "Each assertion has a verification level (PROVEN, INSTRUMENTED, TESTED, UNVERIFIABLE)" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Overall status is PROVEN if all assertions pass" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "verifyAll uses batch ts.Program for performance" — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: "Uses Phase 2 AST verification when ts.Program available, falls back to Phase 1" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Failed assertions include explanation messages" — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
