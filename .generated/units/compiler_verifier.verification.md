# Verification: compiler.verifier

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 8/8 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "file is a valid GlassFile with contract and implementation"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Returns VerificationResult with all assertions checked"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Each assertion has a verification level (PROVEN, INSTRUMENTED, TESTED, UNVERIFIABLE)"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Overall status is PROVEN if all assertions pass"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Returns VerificationResult with status FAILED"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Failed assertions include explanation messages"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Implementation code is never modified"
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Verification is deterministic — same input produces same output" fails: []
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime

- Runtime check needed: "Overall status is PROVEN if all assertions pass" — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Returns VerificationResult with status FAILED" — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Failed assertions include explanation messages" — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Implementation code is never modified" — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: "Verification is deterministic — same input produces same output" fails: [] — Invariant will be checked at runtime
