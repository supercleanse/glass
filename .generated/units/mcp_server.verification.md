# Verification: mcp.server

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 10/10 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] process.argv contains --project <dir> argument
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] stdio transport is available (stdin/stdout)
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] McpServer created with name glass-mcp-server
  - Side-effect guarantee will be checked at runtime: McpServer created with name glass-mcp-server
- [+] All tools registered via registerTools
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Server connected to stdio transport
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Error written to stderr
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] Process exits with code 1
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] One server per process
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidProjectPath
  - Error type 'InvalidProjectPath' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: TransportError
  - Error type 'TransportError' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime

- Runtime check needed: All tools registered via registerTools — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Server connected to stdio transport — Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Error written to stderr — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Process exits with code 1 — Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: One server per process — Invariant will be checked at runtime
- Runtime check needed: Failure mode handled: InvalidProjectPath — Error type 'InvalidProjectPath' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime
- Runtime check needed: Failure mode handled: TransportError — Error type 'TransportError' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime
