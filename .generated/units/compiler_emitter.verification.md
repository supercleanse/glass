# Verification: compiler.emitter

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 13/13 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "files are verified GlassFile objects (all contracts satisfied)"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "verificationResults contains PROVEN status for each file"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "outputDir is a valid writable path"
  - Precondition will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Emitted TypeScript compiles with tsc"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "No Glass artifacts in output code"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Each file has auto-generated header comment"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "tsconfig.json generated for the output"
  - Success guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Returns EmitterError with reason and details"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "No partial files written on failure"
  - Failure guarantee will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Source .glass files are never modified"
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] "Emission is deterministic"
  - Invariant will be checked at runtime
- [+] Failure mode handled: VerificationNotPassed
  - Error type 'VerificationNotPassed' is referenced but handler completeness deferred to runtime

## PROVEN

- [+] Failure mode handled: WriteError
  - Error type 'WriteError' is caught and handled with appropriate response
