**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 13/13 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "verificationResults contains PROVEN status for each file"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "outputDir is a valid writable path"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "Emitted TypeScript compiles with tsc"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "No Glass artifacts in output code"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Each file has auto-generated header comment"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "tsconfig.json generated for the output"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "No partial files written on failure"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification

## PROVEN

- [+] "Returns EmitterError with reason and details"
  - Failure return type contains 'EmitterError'
- [+] "Source .glass files are never modified"
  - 'files' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] "Emission is deterministic"
  - No non-deterministic calls detected
- [+] Failure mode handled: VerificationNotPassed
  - Error 'VerificationNotPassed' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: WriteError
  - Error 'WriteError' found in Err() call via AST
