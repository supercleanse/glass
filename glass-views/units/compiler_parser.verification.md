# Verification: compiler.parser

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 15/15 passed

## PROVEN

- [+] "filePath is a valid string path"
  - Parameter 'filePath' has type 'string' in parseGlassFile()
- [+] "Returns GlassFile with all three sections extracted"
  - Return type 'Result<GlassFile, ParseError>' contains 'GlassFile'
- [+] "Returns ParseError with reason, message, and filePath"
  - Failure return type contains 'ParseError'
- [+] "Original file is never modified"
  - 'file' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] "Parser is stateless"
  - No module-level mutable state detected
- [+] Failure mode handled: FileNotFound
  - Error 'FileNotFound' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidFormat
  - Error 'InvalidFormat' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: MissingSection
  - Error 'MissingSection' found in Err() call via AST
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidSectionContent
  - Error 'InvalidSectionContent' found in Err() call via AST

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "file exists on disk for parseGlassFile"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "content follows .glass format with four sections"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "id, version, and language are populated from Glass Unit header"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Intent has purpose, source, parent, stakeholder, subIntents"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Contract has requires, guarantees, invariants, fails, advisories"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "ParseError includes section where failure occurred"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "file exists on disk for parseGlassFile" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "content follows .glass format with four sections" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "id, version, and language are populated from Glass Unit header" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Intent has purpose, source, parent, stakeholder, subIntents" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Contract has requires, guarantees, invariants, fails, advisories" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "ParseError includes section where failure occurred" — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
