# Verification: cli.cmd_annotate

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 13/13 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Current directory or --source flag points to a valid Glass project
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] unitId argument identifies an existing Glass unit
  - Precondition requires runtime verification
- [+] With target and note: creates annotation and displays ID
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] With --list flag: displays all annotations for the unit
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] With --resolve flag: marks annotation as resolved
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 0
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Reports if unit or annotation not found
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 1
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Annotations are persisted to annotations/ directory
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: ProjectNotFound
  - Error 'ProjectNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: UnitNotFound
  - Error 'UnitNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: AnnotationNotFound
  - Error 'AnnotationNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: InvalidTarget
  - Error 'InvalidTarget' referenced in implementation
