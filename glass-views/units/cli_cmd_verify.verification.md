**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 9/9 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Current directory or --source flag points to a valid Glass project
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] Displays per-unit verification status with pass/fail counts
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Verbose mode shows individual assertion details
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 0 when all units pass
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Displays error details for failing units
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 1 when any unit fails verification
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Verification is read-only — no files modified
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: ProjectNotFound
  - Error 'ProjectNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: VerificationFailed
  - Error 'VerificationFailed' referenced in implementation
