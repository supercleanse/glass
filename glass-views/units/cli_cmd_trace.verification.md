# Verification: cli.cmd_trace

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 11/11 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] Current directory or --source flag points to a valid Glass project
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] unitId argument identifies an existing Glass unit
  - Precondition requires runtime verification
- [+] Displays ancestry chain from root to target unit
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Shows purpose, source, and approval for each ancestor
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Lists direct children of the target unit
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 0
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Reports if unit not found
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Exit code is 1
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Trace display is read-only
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: ProjectNotFound
  - Error 'ProjectNotFound' referenced in implementation
- [+] Failure mode handled: UnitNotFound
  - Error 'UnitNotFound' referenced in implementation
