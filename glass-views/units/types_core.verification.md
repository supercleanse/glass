# Verification: types.core

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 9/9 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "TypeScript strict mode is enabled"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "All types compile without errors under strict mode"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "mapResult, flatMapResult, and collectResults are pure functions"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "All PRD domain concepts have corresponding type definitions"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Types are purely declarative with no runtime side effects"
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] "Result discriminated union uses 'ok' boolean for type narrowing" fails: []
  - Invariant requires runtime verification

## PROVEN

- [+] "Result<T,E> provides Ok and Err constructors with type narrowing"
  - Exports found: Result, Ok, Err
- [+] "GlassFile type represents all three .glass sections"
  - Exports found: GlassFile
- [+] "Contract type includes requires, guarantees, invariants, fails, and advisories" on_failure: []
  - Exports found: Contract

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "TypeScript strict mode is enabled" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required

- Runtime check needed: "All PRD domain concepts have corresponding type definitions" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Types are purely declarative with no runtime side effects" — Invariant requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Result discriminated union uses 'ok' boolean for type narrowing" fails: [] — Invariant requires runtime verification
