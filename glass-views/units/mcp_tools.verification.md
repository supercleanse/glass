# Verification: mcp.tools

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 9/9 passed

## PROVEN

- [+] server is a valid McpServer instance
  - Parameter 'server' has type 'McpServer' in registerTools()

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] projectRoot is a valid directory path
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] Registers 10 tools: glass_init, glass_verify, glass_compile, glass_views, glass_status, glass_tree, glass_trace, glass_annotate, glass_annotations_list
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Each tool has a Zod schema for input validation
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Each tool returns JSON with success boolean and data/error fields
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Tool-specific errors returned as JSON with success: false
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] Tool registration is idempotent
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Tool schemas match their implementations
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: ToolExecutionFailed
  - Error 'ToolExecutionFailed' referenced in implementation

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: projectRoot is a valid directory path — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required

- Runtime check needed: Each tool returns JSON with success boolean and data/error fields — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Tool-specific errors returned as JSON with success: false — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Tool registration is idempotent — Invariant requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Tool schemas match their implementations — Invariant requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: Failure mode handled: ToolExecutionFailed — Error 'ToolExecutionFailed' referenced in implementation
