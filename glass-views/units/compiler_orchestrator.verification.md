# Verification: compiler.orchestrator

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 10/10 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "sourcePaths is an array of valid file paths"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "CompilerOptions provides rootDir and outDir"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "Returns CompilationResult with success: true"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Pipeline stages execute in order: parse, link, verify, emit"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Diagnostics array contains info messages for each stage"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Duration reflects actual elapsed time in milliseconds"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Returns CompilationResult with success: false"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Diagnostics include error messages identifying the failing stage"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Pipeline stages are idempotent" fails: []
  - Invariant requires runtime verification

## PROVEN

- [+] "Source files are never modified"
  - 'files' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "sourcePaths is an array of valid file paths" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "CompilerOptions provides rootDir and outDir" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "Returns CompilationResult with success: true" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Pipeline stages execute in order: parse, link, verify, emit" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Diagnostics array contains info messages for each stage" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Duration reflects actual elapsed time in milliseconds" — Guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Returns CompilationResult with success: false" — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Diagnostics include error messages identifying the failing stage" — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
- Runtime check needed: "Pipeline stages are idempotent" fails: [] — Invariant requires runtime verification
- "GlassCompiler.compile() is currently a stub; real pipeline runs through CLI commands via loadProject()"
