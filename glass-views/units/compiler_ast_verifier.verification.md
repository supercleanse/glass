# Verification: compiler.ast_verifier

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 9/9 passed

## PROVEN

- [+] "file is a valid GlassFile with contract and implementation"
  - Parameter 'file' has type 'GlassFile' in verifyGuaranteesWithAST()
- [+] "Implementation code is never modified"
  - 'code' is not mutated (no assignment/mutation patterns found)
- [+] "Verification is deterministic — same input produces same output"
  - No non-deterministic calls detected

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "program is a valid ts.Program with type checker"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "verifyGuaranteesWithAST proves return types via type checker"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "verifyRequiresWithAST proves parameter types via type checker"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "verifyFailureModesWithAST finds Err() calls, throw statements, catch clauses via AST"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "verifyInvariantsWithAST detects mutation, sensitive data exposure, determinism, statelessness"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "Returns empty assertions array if source file not found in program"
  - Failure guarantee requires runtime verification

## Advisories

- Runtime check needed: "program is a valid ts.Program with type checker" — Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- Runtime check needed: "verifyGuaranteesWithAST proves return types via type checker" — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: "verifyRequiresWithAST proves parameter types via type checker" — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: "verifyFailureModesWithAST finds Err() calls, throw statements, catch clauses via AST" — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: "verifyInvariantsWithAST detects mutation, sensitive data exposure, determinism, statelessness" — Referenced identifiers found in exports
- Runtime check needed: "Returns empty assertions array if source file not found in program" — Failure guarantee requires runtime verification
