# Verification: compiler.ts_program_factory

**Status:** PROVEN

**Assertions:** 13/13 passed

## INSTRUMENTED

- [+] "TypeScript compiler API is available (typescript package installed)"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "projectRoot points to a directory with tsconfig.json"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "GlassFile has a non-empty implementation section"
  - Semantic precondition: runtime verification required
- [+] "createProgramFromGlassFile returns a ts.Program with type checker"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "createBatchProgram returns all source files in a single shared program"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "getVirtualPath returns a deterministic path for a unit ID"
  - Referenced identifiers found in exports
- [+] "Relative imports in implementations are resolved against actual source"
  - Guarantee requires runtime verification
- [+] "Compiler options are cached across calls"
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] "Shebang lines are stripped before parsing"
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] "Virtual files never collide with real file paths"
  - Invariant requires runtime verification
- [+] Failure mode handled: SyntaxError
  - Error 'SyntaxError' referenced; try/catch present

## PROVEN

- [+] "Returns null if implementation has syntax errors"
  - Failure return type contains 'null'
- [+] "Returns null if program creation fails"
  - Failure return type contains 'null'
