=== Glass Unit ===
id: adapters.typescript
version: 0.1.0
language: typescript

=== Intent ===
purpose: Provide TypeScript language adapter for Glass compilation
source: prd (PRD Section 13)
parent: glass.adapters
stakeholder: engineering

sub-intents: []

=== Contract ===
requires:
  - GlassFile has language: typescript

guarantees:
  on_success:
    - LanguageAdapter interface defines name, fileExtension, and compile method
    - typescriptAdapter implements LanguageAdapter for TypeScript targets
  on_failure: []

invariants:
  - Adapter is stateless

fails:

advisories:
  - Placeholder implementation — actual TypeScript compilation handled by emitter

=== Implementation ===
/**
 * TypeScript language adapter for Glass.
 *
 * Translates Glass contracts into TypeScript-native constructs
 * and maps verification results back to contract terms.
 */

export interface LanguageAdapter {
  name: string;
  fileExtension: string;
  compile(source: string): Promise<string>;
}

export const typescriptAdapter: LanguageAdapter = {
  name: "typescript",
  fileExtension: ".ts",
  async compile(source: string): Promise<string> {
    // Placeholder: will be implemented in Task 13 (TypeScript adapter)
    return source;
  },
};
